to draft gate 2.

## What the loop did NOT verify (gate 1)

This gate auto-closed on-plan; the full close-intermediate ceremony did
not run, so the per-criterion deferred-verification list was **not**
enumerated. Any acceptance criterion whose verification is deferred
(loop-sandbox limit, cross-repo coordination, real-system access) is
unrecorded here. Gate 2's close MUST reconcile these
before the feature's terminal verdict — auto-close cannot enumerate them.
