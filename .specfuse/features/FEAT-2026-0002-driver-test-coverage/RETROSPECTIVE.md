# RETROSPECTIVE — FEAT-2026-0002 Driver run-loop test coverage

Single-gate feature; five substantive WUs (T01–T05) plus this G1-CLOSE
ceremony. Roadmap goal: cover the driver's remaining orchestration paths
and the scaffold modules (`loop.py`, `validate-event.py`, `lint_plan.py`,
`_miniyaml.py`) so this repo's `coverage --fail-under` floor climbs from
70 to the methodology default of 90.

## Per-WU retrospective

### T01 — `loop.py` orchestration coverage

`tests/test_loop_orchestration.py` (new) covered `squash_commit` soft-reset
fold-in, `find_feature` 0/1/many, `require_git_ready` happy + missing
commits + non-repo, dispatch error arms (CalledProcessError, missing
binary), `BlockingIOError` lock contention, gate-budget halt, and
`main()` argparse. Landed in **2 attempts** at high effort (1504 s total,
$3.47). Attempt 1 produced the bulk of the suite (~82k output tokens) but
needed one iteration to align fixtures with the live driver shape;
attempt 2 finalized in 107 s. Drove `loop.py` from 87% → **97%**. No
escalation triggers fired.

### T02 — `validate-event.py` coverage

`tests/test_validate_event.py` (new) covered the schema validator's
accept/reject arms, unknown event_type, malformed JSON, and a regression
against a real driver-emitted event. **First dispatch blocked**
(`agent_reported_blocked`, 1133 s, $2.65): AC 4 as authored asserted the
schema *accepts* a real event from FEAT-2026-0008's `events.jsonl`, but
those events use `source: "driver"` which is intentionally NOT in the
orchestrator-protocol schema's source enum. The agent correctly identified
the contradiction and escalated rather than weaken the schema. Re-arm
(commit `5bfad25`) inverted AC 4 to "rejects the real event" — semantically
the right boundary evidence with the right polarity — and added
`jsonschema` to `pyproject.toml`'s dev deps. Re-armed dispatch landed in
**1 attempt** (854 s, $2.14). Drove `validate-event.py` from 0% → **97%**.

### T03 — `lint_plan.py` error arms

`tests/test_lint_plan_errors.py` (new) covered the 11 named error arms
(missing PLAN, missing FM keys, invalid type/status/effort,
closing-sequence mismatch, `main()` print/argparse) plus a regression on
the bundled FEAT-2026-0001 fixture. **First dispatch spinning-detected**
after 3 attempts (2337 s total, $4.09): a `ruff` F401 (`import sys`
unused) was re-introduced each attempt because the agent did not run the
linter locally before declaring complete. Re-arm (commit `5bfad25`)
added explicit pre-flight lint discipline to the WU AC. Re-armed
dispatch landed in **1 attempt** (379 s, $0.73). Drove `lint_plan.py`
from 79% → **99%**.

### T04 — `_miniyaml.py` error arms

`tests/test_miniyaml_negative.py` extended with escape-handling and
indent-error fixtures covering flow-list double-quote escape arms,
`_decode_double_quoted` escape decode + error paths, and scattered
indent arms. Landed in **1 attempt** (639 s, $1.02). Drove `_miniyaml.py`
from 87% → **100%**. No escalation triggers fired.

### T05 — coverage `--fail-under` floor flip

`.specfuse/verification.yml` and `scripts/smoke-test.sh` both flipped
from `--fail-under=70` to `--fail-under=90`; the deviation comment block
in `verification.yml` removed. Two-site flip in one commit, by design
(see LEARNINGS [FEAT-2026-0002/G1-CLOSE] on the floor-flip enumeration
rule). Landed in **1 attempt** (45 s, $0.17) — the WU was deliberately
trivial because per-module coverage thresholds in T01–T04 had already
satisfied the new floor before the flip committed.

## §Feature-arc retrospective

The `roadmap_goal` is met. Pre-feature TOTAL was 78% with one targeted
module at 0% (`validate-event.py`) and three between 79% and 87%. After
T01–T05:

| Module                                  | Pre   | Post  |
|-----------------------------------------|-------|-------|
| `.specfuse/scripts/loop.py`             | 87%   | 97%   |
| `.specfuse/scripts/validate-event.py`   | 0%    | 97%   |
| `.specfuse/scripts/lint_plan.py`        | 79%   | 99%   |
| `.specfuse/scripts/_miniyaml.py`        | 87%   | 100%  |
| **TOTAL**                               | **78%** | **97%** |

The floor flip in T05 made the new ≥ 90% threshold enforceable at both
`code` gate sites (`.specfuse/verification.yml`,
`scripts/smoke-test.sh`); CI delegates to those scripts, so the two-site
flip suffices for end-to-end enforcement.

Per-module AC shape (`coverage report --include=<file> --fail-under=N`)
worked as designed: each WU's claim was falsifiable about its own
surface, independent of TOTAL drift. The dependency edge from per-module
WUs (T01–T04 parallel) to a single floor-flip WU (T05) collapsed the
risk of flipping the floor before the modules supported it — T05's job
was structurally a no-op-if-prerequisites-met flip and ran in 45 s
because of it.

Two of five WUs took a re-arm. Both surfaced the same general class:
acceptance criteria that referenced external state at author-time
without the author verifying the polarity / lint cleanliness against
that state. The fixes were spec-side, not code-side. Both lessons are
appended to `.specfuse/LEARNINGS.md`.

## §Recursive audit (per LEARNINGS [FEAT-2026-0008/G1-CLOSE])

Three-command check, ran fresh at close time:

**(a) Coverage** — `coverage run --source=.specfuse/scripts -m unittest
discover -s tests && coverage report`:

```
Name                                  Stmts   Miss  Cover
---------------------------------------------------------
.specfuse/scripts/_miniyaml.py          230      0   100%
.specfuse/scripts/adopt_feature.py       71      2    97%
.specfuse/scripts/gh_backend.py          27      1    96%
.specfuse/scripts/gh_features.py         40      4    90%
.specfuse/scripts/lint_plan.py          116      1    99%
.specfuse/scripts/loop.py               572     20    97%
.specfuse/scripts/validate-event.py     127      4    97%
---------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                                  1183     32    97%
```

TOTAL = 97% (≥ 90% required). Per-WU per-module thresholds: `loop.py`
97% (≥ 95% required), `validate-event.py` 97% (≥ 90%), `lint_plan.py`
99% (≥ 90%), `_miniyaml.py` 100% (≥ 90%). All AC thresholds met.

**(b) Floor sites** — `grep -n "fail-under" .specfuse/verification.yml
scripts/smoke-test.sh`:

```
.specfuse/verification.yml:30:    # --fail-under=90 matches the methodology default.
.specfuse/verification.yml:31:    command: "coverage run --source=.specfuse/scripts -m unittest discover -s tests && coverage report --fail-under=90"
scripts/smoke-test.sh:56:echo "==> [gate: coverage] coverage --fail-under=90"
scripts/smoke-test.sh:58:  && coverage report --fail-under=90
```

Both sites read `=90`. No drift.

**(c) Structural lint** — `python3 .specfuse/scripts/lint_plan.py
.specfuse/features/FEAT-2026-0002-driver-test-coverage`:

```
OK — .specfuse/features/FEAT-2026-0002-driver-test-coverage is structurally valid.
```

Exit 0.

All three sub-checks PASS. The feature met its own goal; the close
ceremony is not hollow-passing a coverage feature.

## §Feature-arc verdict

**FEAT-2026-0002 done — methodology coverage default reached.** This
repo's `coverage --fail-under` floor is now 90 at every site, measured
TOTAL is 97%, and each of the four targeted modules sits at or above its
per-WU acceptance threshold. The deviation between this repo's own
`code` gate and the methodology default is closed. Two WUs required a
re-arm but neither for a code-side reason; both surfaced spec-authoring
rules that are now durable in `.specfuse/LEARNINGS.md`. No carry-over
to a successor feature.
