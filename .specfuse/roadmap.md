# Roadmap

The master plan for this repository's own work. Each feature lives in its
own folder under `.specfuse/features/` once started, with a `PLAN.md` (task
graph), `GATE-NN.md` files, and `WU-*.md` files. This roadmap owns *feature*
definitions and *feature* status; the PLAN owns the *graph*; GATE files own
*gate* status; WU files own *work-unit* status. One fact, one home — the
same split the Specfuse Orchestrator uses.

`FEAT-2026-0001` is reserved as the **bundled worked-example fixture** under
`.specfuse/features/FEAT-2026-0001-health-endpoint/`. It is not on this
repo's planned work; it ships as the self-demonstrating reference
installation a target project copies via `init.sh`.

Status: `planned` → `active` → `done` (or `abandoned`).

## FEAT-2026-0002 — Driver run-loop test coverage

**Why.** This repo's own `code` coverage gate ships at `--fail-under=35`,
deliberately below the methodology's ≥ 90% default
(`.specfuse/verification.yml`). The gap is concentrated in the orchestration
paths of `loop.py`: `run()` (the attempt loop and gate-completion flow),
`squash_commit`, `log_event`, `find_feature`, `load_graph`, `load_wu`,
`require_git_ready`, the `dispatch` subprocess invocation, and the
`blocked_human` escalation flow end-to-end. The parse/decide/verify core is
already covered by the existing 27 unit tests.

**Goal.** Land integration tests that exercise the run-loop without
spawning a real `claude -p`, then raise this repo's `--fail-under` floor
toward 90. Specifically:

- `run()` happy path (a single passing WU lands a squashed commit and
  flips status to `done`).
- `run()` failed-then-passed path (attempt 1 fails verify, attempt 2
  passes; assert the failure note is written, the attempt counter is
  written to frontmatter, and only one squashed commit ends up on HEAD).
- `run()` agent-reported-blocked path (assert single attempt, `blocked_human`
  status, `human_escalation` event with `agent_reported_blocked` reason,
  `git reset --hard` ran).
- `run()` spinning-detection path (three failed verify cycles → `blocked_human`,
  `human_escalation` with `spinning detected` reason).
- `squash_commit` against a temp git repo: produces one commit with the
  correct trailer, folds away any commits the (stub) agent made.
- `log_event` round-trip: appends a single line of valid JSON with the
  expected fields.
- `find_feature` with zero/one/multiple actives.
- `require_git_ready` happy + missing-commits + non-repo (already covered
  manually after the original fix; promote to unit tests).

**Gate 1 (passed).** Single-gate feature, five substantive WUs:

- **T01** — `tests/test_loop_orchestration.py` raised `loop.py` from 87%
  to ≥ 95% by covering `squash_commit` soft-reset, `find_feature` 0/1/many,
  `require_git_ready`, dispatch error arms, lock contention, gate-budget
  halt, and `main()` argparse. Landed in 2 attempts (high effort).
- **T02** — `tests/test_validate_event.py` raised `validate-event.py` from
  0% to 97% by covering schema accept/reject and a real-event regression.
  First attempt blocked (AC 4 polarity error: the spec asserted the schema
  *accepts* a driver-emitted event, but the orchestrator's schema
  intentionally rejects `source: "driver"`); re-arm inverted the AC and
  added `jsonschema` to dev deps. Landed in 1 attempt post-re-arm.
- **T03** — `tests/test_lint_plan_errors.py` raised `lint_plan.py` from
  79% to 99% by covering the 11 named error arms + a regression on the
  bundled FEAT-2026-0001 fixture. First dispatch spun 3 attempts on a
  ruff F401 (`import sys` unused); re-arm added pre-flight lint discipline.
  Landed in 1 attempt post-re-arm.
- **T04** — `tests/test_miniyaml_negative.py` extended raised `_miniyaml.py`
  from 87% to 100% with escape-handling and indent-error fixtures. Landed
  in 1 attempt.
- **T05** — `.specfuse/verification.yml` and `scripts/smoke-test.sh`
  flipped from `--fail-under=70` to `--fail-under=90`; deviation comment
  removed. Landed in 1 attempt (45 s).

Post-gate coverage: TOTAL = **97%** (was 78% at feature start), with each
targeted module at or above its per-WU threshold (`loop.py` 97%,
`validate-event.py` 97%, `lint_plan.py` 99%, `_miniyaml.py` 100%). The
two-site `--fail-under` floor (`.specfuse/verification.yml` +
`scripts/smoke-test.sh`) reads `=90` and matches the methodology default.
GATE-01 status: `passed`.

**Status: done.** `roadmap_goal` met — this repo's coverage floor now
matches the methodology default (≥ 90%), with measured TOTAL at 97% and
no module under 90%. See `RETROSPECTIVE.md §Feature-arc verdict`.


## FEAT-2026-0010 — Roadmap restructure: add + archive

**Why.** The roadmap file currently mixes detail sections for every
feature — done, abandoned, planned, active — into one document. As
done features accumulate, `pick-feature` (and any other reader of the
roadmap) loads ~70% irrelevant context every invocation. The file has
also been edited entirely by hand; there is no skill to append a new
planned entry, and no mechanism to graduate detail sections out of the
hot file when work completes.

**Goal.** Land the structural changes that let the roadmap stay lean
without losing history:

- Split `.specfuse/roadmap.md` so detail sections cover only `planned`
  and `active` features; move `done` and `abandoned` detail sections
  to a new `.specfuse/roadmap-archive.md` (table rows stay in the
  main file with a link to the archive anchor).
- Migrate FEAT-2026-0003..0008's existing detail sections to the
  archive as the first dogfooding pass.
- Ship a `roadmap-add` skill: interactive append of a new planned
  row + detail section, auto-picking the next FEAT-YYYY-NNNN ID,
  honoring reserved IDs in repo history.
- Ship a `roadmap-archive` skill: given a FEAT-ID (or auto-detected
  done/abandoned rows with detail still inline), cut the detail
  section and append to the archive, leaving the table row intact.
- Hook the driver: when `loop.py` flips `PLAN.md` status to
  `complete`, suggest (or auto-fire) `roadmap-archive` for that
  feature. Manual-first cut; auto a follow-up if the manual flow is
  reliable.

**Benefits.** Reduce hot-path context for every roadmap reader.
Make adding a planned entry a one-command operation, removing the
friction that causes ad-hoc shorthand to leak into the table.
Preserve full history in a file that's never loaded on the hot
path. Foundation for FEAT-2026-0011, which adds new columns and
scoring data the table can't carry while it's still hand-edited.

**Verification.** `pick-feature` invoked against the restructured
roadmap loads strictly less context than today (measure: line count
of the file it reads). `roadmap-add` writes a row + detail section
that round-trips through the archive flow without losing data.
`roadmap-archive` is idempotent (running twice does not duplicate
the archive entry). Migration of 0003..0008 leaves the table
unchanged in shape; archive contains 6 detail sections matching
the originals byte-for-byte except for the new archive header.

**Status: planned.** Folder exists at
`.specfuse/features/FEAT-2026-0010-roadmap-restructure/` (PLAN.md,
GATE-01.md, GATE-02.md, 4 substantive WUs, 4 closing WUs). Land
before FEAT-2026-0011 (scoring needs the restructured table to
carry the new columns).

## FEAT-2026-0011 — Scoring framework for roadmap features

**Why.** Today the roadmap has no scoring signal — `pick-feature`
ranks by recency and gut feel. Christian's "Feature Prioritization
Guidelines" methodology defines an objective formula
(`(WCI×CI) + (WBV×BV) + (WTF×TF) − (WCOI×COI) − (WR×R)`, normalized
to 0–100) that decouples stable per-feature criteria (objective,
data-backed) from time-varying weights (quarterly strategic
objectives). The methodology has been written down once; it needs
to land as a reusable Specfuse component so every repo (and
ultimately the orchestrator) inherits the same prioritization
discipline.

**Goal.** Land the scoring stack as a set of artifacts + skills.

Artifacts:

- `.specfuse/scoring-criteria.md` per repo, with stable definitions
  of what each criterion (CI/BV/TF/COI/R) MEANS for the project,
  including project-specific sub-criteria (e.g. specfuse-loop's
  CI = "methodology user impact: reduce operator interrupts,
  shorten WU spin time, lower per-feature cost"). Carries a
  `revision:` field and a `## Revision log` for audited evolution.
- `.specfuse/priorities/YYYY-QN.yml` per quarter, carrying the
  current period's strategic objective + the five weights. Latest
  file by name is active; history preserved by never overwriting.
- Per-feature scoring data lives in the roadmap detail section as
  a YAML block (not in the table row). Table row carries only
  `ID | Title | Status | Budget`. Score is rendered, never
  stored.
- `.specfuse/roadmap-ranked.md`, auto-regenerated, git-tracked, the
  always-current rendered view of priorities. Header includes the
  period, weights, and timestamp used to compute it.
- Audit lives in-detail as a `## Estimate revisions` subsection in
  each feature's roadmap entry, travels with the feature into the
  archive on completion.

Skills:

- `define-scoring-criteria` — bootstrap + `--revise` the per-repo
  criteria file. Reads CLAUDE.md, roadmap, LEARNINGS; asks "who are
  your customers", "what's strategic for this product", "what does
  drift risk mean here"; drafts the file, asks user to confirm.
- `set-priorities` — write the current quarter's weights file. On
  each call, snapshots the active period and starts a new one if
  the quarter rolled over.
- `roadmap-estimate` — fill CI/BV/TF/R + Budget bucket for a
  feature. Reads scoring-criteria.md as ground truth for the
  rubric. COI derived from Budget bucket via fixed mapping
  (`<$5 → 1, $5-25 → 4, $25-100 → 7, >$100 → 10`). Wires
  events.jsonl telemetry (actual cost / attempts / escalations
  across past features) as a grounding aid. For `active`
  features, `--reason` is mandatory; revision is appended to the
  feature's `## Estimate revisions` subsection.
- `roadmap-rank` — compute Feature Score per current weights
  using the methodology's formula + normalization. Two modes:
  stdout (interactive ranked view), or `--snapshot` (write
  `.specfuse/roadmap-ranked.md`). Active features and planned
  features ranked in separate sections.

Wiring:

- `pick-feature` updated to read `roadmap-ranked.md` (or call
  `roadmap-rank` if the snapshot is stale).
- `set-priorities` / `roadmap-estimate` / `roadmap-add` /
  `roadmap-archive` each call `roadmap-rank --snapshot` as their
  final step so the rendered ranking never goes stale.
- `init.sh` ships templates for `scoring-criteria.md` and a starter
  `priorities/<current-quarter>.yml`.
- Bootstrap specfuse-loop's OWN `scoring-criteria.md` and an
  initial `priorities/<current-quarter>.yml` as part of this
  feature (eats its own dog food).

**Benefits.** Objective prioritization across the backlog. Decoupled
"what does this feature offer" (stable) from "what are we chasing
this quarter" (time-varying). Reproducible scoring across repos and,
later, across the orchestrator's component repos. Audit trail when
estimates change. Foundation for the orchestrator to aggregate
features across component repos under one product-level weight set.

**Verification.** Compute Feature Scores for FEAT-2026-0010 and a
backfilled set of past features; manually validate the ranking
matches Christian's intuitive ordering for at least one historical
quarter. `roadmap-estimate` blocks re-rating `active` features
without `--reason`. `roadmap-rank --snapshot` regenerates a
deterministic file given the same inputs. `scoring-criteria.md`
revision flow lets a user change the rubric without losing prior
estimates' grounding (revision log captures the change).

**Status: planned.** Depends on FEAT-2026-0010 landing first (table
shape needs to be ready to carry the new column shape).

## FEAT-2026-0012 — Closing-WU deliverable guard

**Why.** FEAT-2026-0008 closed the hollow-pass surface for
`type: implementation` WUs via three driver-side guards (zero-token,
`files_changed` diff, smoke-import). Closing-sequence WUs
(`plan-next`, `close`, `retrospective`, `lessons`, `docs`) have the
same hollow-pass surface and none of the three FEAT-2026-0008 guards
catch them:

- Zero-token misses: the agent billed real tokens.
- `files_changed` diff guard misses: per FEAT-2026-0008/T02, empty or
  absent `files_changed` opts out, and closing WUs typically emit
  empty lists.
- Smoke-import misses: closing WUs produce prose deliverables, not
  importable symbols.

Observed live in an external (IaC) project's feature dogfood: a
terminal-gate `plan-next` WU billed `cost_usd: 0.90`,
`output_tokens: 4389`, emitted RESULT `status: complete`, and the
driver flipped `attempts: 1` / `status: done` while the agent had
never invoked `Write` / `Edit`: `GATE-NN-REVIEW.md` absent,
`PLAN.md status: active` unchanged, roadmap row unchanged. The
driver believed an honest RESULT block without confirmation.

Also encountered locally during FEAT-2026-0002/G1-CLOSE: the close
agent correctly flipped PLAN.md status, roadmap row, and wrote
RETROSPECTIVE.md — but only because the WU spec told it to. If the
agent had emitted PASS without writing, the driver would have
believed it and FEAT-2026-0002 would have closed hollow. The same
gap blocks reliable auto-progression of the roadmap row on feature
close (current behavior depends entirely on the close-agent
following the WU AC).

**Goal.** A driver-side guard, analogous in shape to FEAT-2026-0008's
three guards, that asserts type-keyed closing-deliverable existence
between successful verify+squash and the status-flip-to-done.
Type-keyed assertion table:

- `retrospective` → `<feature_dir>/RETROSPECTIVE.md` exists +
  size > N bytes (small floor, ~200).
- `lessons` → `git diff head_before -- .specfuse/LEARNINGS.md`
  shows ≥1 added line.
- `docs` → at least one file in `<feature_dir>` or
  `.specfuse/roadmap.md` shows a diff against `head_before`.
- `plan-next` → `<feature_dir>/GATE-<N>-REVIEW.md` exists +
  non-empty AND one of: (a) next gate's `work_units` non-empty
  in PLAN.md, (b) PLAN.md `status: done`, (c) roadmap row `done`.
- `close` → RETROSPECTIVE.md exists + non-empty AND LEARNINGS.md
  diff AND PLAN.md `status: done` AND roadmap row `done`.
- `implementation` → unchanged; FEAT-2026-0008's three guards
  already cover.

Failure rolls back via `git reset --hard head_before`, records an
`attempt_outcome` event with `outcome: "closing_deliverable_missing"`
naming the failed assertion, and counts as a verification failure
in the attempt loop — three in a row escalate to `blocked_human`.

**Verification.** New tests under `tests/test_loop_closing_guard.py`
covering negative case (agent emits PASS without writing the
type-keyed deliverable, guard fires, attempt fails) and positive
case (agent writes everything, guard passes). Recursive audit per
LEARNINGS [FEAT-2026-0008/G1-CLOSE]: the close ceremony for this
feature must run the new guard against itself — if any deliverable
is missing, the close WU emits `status: blocked`, not `complete`.

**Status: planned.** Independent of FEAT-2026-0010/0011. Detail the
first gate's WUs when ready to start. Single gate, one substantive
WU (`closing-deliverable-guard`) + `close` ceremony — mirrors
FEAT-2026-0008's shape.

## FEAT-2026-0013 — CI integration_workspace cleanup race fix

**Why.** The repo's CI suite intermittently fails with
`OSError: [Errno 39] Directory not empty: '/tmp/.../.git/objects'`
when `tests/test_driver_integration.py::integration_workspace`'s
`tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` context manager exits and Python 3.12's
`shutil.rmtree` races against leftover file descriptors holding parts
of `.git/objects`. Three observed occurrences:

- 2026-06-10 push, `test_no_files_changed_in_result_block_runs_squash_as_today`
  — root cause was an unclosed `.specfuse/.loop.lock` fd; fixed by the
  `try/finally` close in `loop.py::run()` (commit `7abc809`).
- 2026-06-11 PR #7 first run,
  `test_cumulative_duration_written_to_frontmatter` — same OSError, but
  the prior fix doesn't touch the test that's failing now. A second
  unclosed handle (or git subprocess that hasn't exited yet) is still
  leaking inside `integration_workspace`.

A subsequent CI run on the same PR passed without code changes,
confirming the race is timing-dependent and not deterministic. CI
flakes erode the verification-as-oracle property even when each
individual failure has a reproducible root cause, and the team has
now spent two halt-and-investigate cycles on the same symptom shape.

**Goal.** Eliminate the race so the integration-test path is
deterministic on Python 3.12 CI runners.

Likely fix paths to evaluate:

- `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory(ignore_cleanup_errors=True)` in
  `integration_workspace` (Py 3.10+). Suppresses the symptom; doesn't
  fix the underlying leak.
- Audit `integration_workspace` for unclosed git subprocess handles
  and add explicit `subprocess.run` `check=True` + completion-wait at
  exit points. Fixes the root cause.
- Move `.specfuse/.loop.lock` open-then-flock pattern out of test
  paths that don't need it (the lock isn't load-bearing inside a
  TemporaryDirectory the test owns).

A single substantive WU per fix-path; recursive audit at close runs
the suite 50× in a loop and asserts zero flakes.

**Gate 1 (passed).** T01 audited `integration_workspace` and applied
two coupled fixes in one attempt (362.795 s, $0.327): (a) `git -c
gc.auto=0` on every `git` invocation inside the fixture body, killing
gc.autoDetach's post-parent-exit background-subprocess class; (b) a
`git -C <root> rev-parse HEAD` sync barrier in a `finally:` block
after the `yield root` line, forcing index-lock flush and pending
writer release before `TemporaryDirectory` teardown. `subprocess.run`
calls inside the fixture use `check=True` with completion-wait;
fixture remains a `@contextmanager` yielding `Path` (no API break).
50× local audit at T01 close: 50/50 clean. GATE-01 status: `passed`.

**Status: done.** `roadmap_goal` met — the close-session 50×
recursive audit, post-T01-squash on HEAD `2a9e2aa`, shows 50/50
unittest exits 0 with no `OSError: Directory not empty`, no
`FAILED`, no `ERROR`. `tail -1 | sort | uniq -c` returned one
distinct line across 50 runs (driver stdout from an inner
integration test, not unittest's verdict — see RETROSPECTIVE.md
"Reading the output"); exit-code count confirmed PASS:50 FAIL:0.
The race is eliminated locally; CI on a Py 3.12 runner is the
field test (next PR run). Two `[FEAT-2026-0013/G1-CLOSE]` entries
landed in LEARNINGS.md covering the gc.auto=0 + sync-barrier rule
and the `tail -1` oracle fragility. See `RETROSPECTIVE.md
§Feature-arc verdict`.

## FEAT-2026-0014 — GitHub Actions Node.js 20 deprecation bump

**Why.** GitHub will force Node.js 20 actions to Node.js 24 on
2026-06-16; Node 20 removed from runners 2026-09-16. CI's
`actions/checkout@v4` and `actions/setup-python@v5` both emit the
deprecation warning today. Without action, the forced upgrade lands
during a normal CI run with no warning of which workflows will break
their action pinning behavior — exactly the failure mode this repo's
methodology is meant to surface before merge, not after.

**Goal.** Bump `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to action versions that
support Node 24 natively (currently: `actions/checkout@v5`,
`actions/setup-python@v6` — verify the major-version compatibility at
WU author time, not assume).

Single substantive WU: edit `ci.yml` action `uses:` lines; trigger a
CI run on the PR and confirm no deprecation warning fires; assert
both jobs still pass against the existing test suite.

**Status: done.** `roadmap_goal` met — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
pins `actions/checkout@v6` and `actions/setup-python@v6`; no stale
`@v[0-5]` pins remain. Five days of deadline margin (closed
2026-06-11; forced upgrade 2026-06-16). T01 landed in 1 attempt
after a WU re-arm; the original ACs coupled the WU to the
operator's `gh` CLI auth state and burned 5 dispatches before the
re-arm dropped the host-coupled checks. See
`RETROSPECTIVE.md §Feature-arc verdict`.

## Notes

- Correlation IDs are allocated here, sequentially per year: `FEAT-YYYY-NNNN`.
  Work units take `FEAT-YYYY-NNNN/TNN` for substantive units,
  `FEAT-YYYY-NNNN/G<n>-(RETRO|LESSONS|DOCS|PLAN)` for the four-WU closing
  sequence, and `FEAT-YYYY-NNNN/G<n>-CLOSE` for the single-gate `close`
  alternative — see `.specfuse/rules/correlation-ids.md`.
- The feature folder name carries the full ID plus a slug, so it greps,
  sorts, and threads cleanly.
- **Read `.specfuse/LEARNINGS.md` before detailing a new feature.** It is
  the accumulated output of every gate's lessons step and exists to make
  the next plan better than the last.
