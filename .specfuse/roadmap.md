# Roadmap

The master plan for this repository's own work. Each feature lives in its
own folder under `.specfuse/features/` once started, with a `PLAN.md` (task
graph), `GATE-NN.md` files, and `WU-*.md` files. This roadmap owns *feature*
definitions and *feature* status; the PLAN owns the *graph*; GATE files own
*gate* status; WU files own *work-unit* status. One fact, one home — the
same split the Specfuse Orchestrator uses.

`FEAT-2026-0001` is reserved as the **bundled worked-example fixture** under
`.specfuse/features/FEAT-2026-0001-health-endpoint/`. It is not on this
repo's planned work; it ships as the self-demonstrating reference
installation a target project copies via `init.sh`.

## FEAT-2026-0011 — Scoring framework for roadmap features

**Why.** Today the roadmap has no scoring signal — `pick-feature`
ranks by recency and gut feel. Christian's "Feature Prioritization
Guidelines" methodology defines an objective formula
(`(WCI×CI) + (WBV×BV) + (WTF×TF) − (WCOI×COI) − (WR×R)`, normalized
to 0–100) that decouples stable per-feature criteria (objective,
data-backed) from time-varying weights (quarterly strategic
objectives). The methodology has been written down once; it needs
to land as a reusable Specfuse component so every repo (and
ultimately the orchestrator) inherits the same prioritization
discipline.

**Goal.** Land the scoring stack as a set of artifacts + skills.

Artifacts:

- `.specfuse/scoring-criteria.md` per repo, with stable definitions
  of what each criterion (CI/BV/TF/COI/R) MEANS for the project,
  including project-specific sub-criteria (e.g. specfuse-loop's
  CI = "methodology user impact: reduce operator interrupts,
  shorten WU spin time, lower per-feature cost"). Carries a
  `revision:` field and a `## Revision log` for audited evolution.
- `.specfuse/priorities/YYYY-QN.yml` per quarter, carrying the
  current period's strategic objective + the five weights. Latest
  file by name is active; history preserved by never overwriting.
- Per-feature scoring data lives in the roadmap detail section as
  a YAML block (not in the table row). Table row carries only
  `ID | Title | Status | Budget`. Score is rendered, never
  stored.
- `.specfuse/roadmap-ranked.md`, auto-regenerated, git-tracked, the
  always-current rendered view of priorities. Header includes the
  period, weights, and timestamp used to compute it.
- Audit lives in-detail as a `## Estimate revisions` subsection in
  each feature's roadmap entry, travels with the feature into the
  archive on completion.

Skills:

- `define-scoring-criteria` — bootstrap + `--revise` the per-repo
  criteria file. Reads CLAUDE.md, roadmap, LEARNINGS; asks "who are
  your customers", "what's strategic for this product", "what does
  drift risk mean here"; drafts the file, asks user to confirm.
- `set-priorities` — write the current quarter's weights file. On
  each call, snapshots the active period and starts a new one if
  the quarter rolled over.
- `roadmap-estimate` — fill CI/BV/TF/R + Budget bucket for a
  feature. Reads scoring-criteria.md as ground truth for the
  rubric. COI derived from Budget bucket via fixed mapping
  (`<$5 → 1, $5-25 → 4, $25-100 → 7, >$100 → 10`). Wires
  events.jsonl telemetry (actual cost / attempts / escalations
  across past features) as a grounding aid. For `active`
  features, `--reason` is mandatory; revision is appended to the
  feature's `## Estimate revisions` subsection.
- `roadmap-rank` — compute Feature Score per current weights
  using the methodology's formula + normalization. Two modes:
  stdout (interactive ranked view), or `--snapshot` (write
  `.specfuse/roadmap-ranked.md`). Active features and planned
  features ranked in separate sections.

Wiring:

- `pick-feature` updated to read `roadmap-ranked.md` (or call
  `roadmap-rank` if the snapshot is stale).
- `set-priorities` / `roadmap-estimate` / `roadmap-add` /
  `roadmap-archive` each call `roadmap-rank --snapshot` as their
  final step so the rendered ranking never goes stale.
- `init.sh` ships templates for `scoring-criteria.md` and a starter
  `priorities/<current-quarter>.yml`.
- Bootstrap specfuse-loop's OWN `scoring-criteria.md` and an
  initial `priorities/<current-quarter>.yml` as part of this
  feature (eats its own dog food).

**Benefits.** Objective prioritization across the backlog. Decoupled
"what does this feature offer" (stable) from "what are we chasing
this quarter" (time-varying). Reproducible scoring across repos and,
later, across the orchestrator's component repos. Audit trail when
estimates change. Foundation for the orchestrator to aggregate
features across component repos under one product-level weight set.

**Verification.** Compute Feature Scores for FEAT-2026-0010 and a
backfilled set of past features; manually validate the ranking
matches Christian's intuitive ordering for at least one historical
quarter. `roadmap-estimate` blocks re-rating `active` features
without `--reason`. `roadmap-rank --snapshot` regenerates a
deterministic file given the same inputs. `scoring-criteria.md`
revision flow lets a user change the rubric without losing prior
estimates' grounding (revision log captures the change).

**Status: planned.** Depends on FEAT-2026-0010 landing first (table
shape needs to be ready to carry the new column shape).

## FEAT-2026-0012 — Closing-WU deliverable guard

**Why.** FEAT-2026-0008 closed the hollow-pass surface for
`type: implementation` WUs via three driver-side guards (zero-token,
`files_changed` diff, smoke-import). Closing-sequence WUs
(`plan-next`, `close`, `retrospective`, `lessons`, `docs`) have the
same hollow-pass surface and none of the three FEAT-2026-0008 guards
catch them:

- Zero-token misses: the agent billed real tokens.
- `files_changed` diff guard misses: per FEAT-2026-0008/T02, empty or
  absent `files_changed` opts out, and closing WUs typically emit
  empty lists.
- Smoke-import misses: closing WUs produce prose deliverables, not
  importable symbols.

Observed live in an external (IaC) project's feature dogfood: a
terminal-gate `plan-next` WU billed `cost_usd: 0.90`,
`output_tokens: 4389`, emitted RESULT `status: complete`, and the
driver flipped `attempts: 1` / `status: done` while the agent had
never invoked `Write` / `Edit`: `GATE-NN-REVIEW.md` absent,
`PLAN.md status: active` unchanged, roadmap row unchanged. The
driver believed an honest RESULT block without confirmation.

Also encountered locally during FEAT-2026-0002/G1-CLOSE: the close
agent correctly flipped PLAN.md status, roadmap row, and wrote
RETROSPECTIVE.md — but only because the WU spec told it to. If the
agent had emitted PASS without writing, the driver would have
believed it and FEAT-2026-0002 would have closed hollow. The same
gap blocks reliable auto-progression of the roadmap row on feature
close (current behavior depends entirely on the close-agent
following the WU AC).

**Goal.** A driver-side guard, analogous in shape to FEAT-2026-0008's
three guards, that asserts type-keyed closing-deliverable existence
between successful verify+squash and the status-flip-to-done.
Type-keyed assertion table:

- `retrospective` → `<feature_dir>/RETROSPECTIVE.md` exists +
  size > N bytes (small floor, ~200).
- `lessons` → `git diff head_before -- .specfuse/LEARNINGS.md`
  shows ≥1 added line.
- `docs` → at least one file in `<feature_dir>` or
  `.specfuse/roadmap.md` shows a diff against `head_before`.
- `plan-next` → `<feature_dir>/GATE-<N>-REVIEW.md` exists +
  non-empty AND one of: (a) next gate's `work_units` non-empty
  in PLAN.md, (b) PLAN.md `status: done`, (c) roadmap row `done`.
- `close` → RETROSPECTIVE.md exists + non-empty AND LEARNINGS.md
  diff AND PLAN.md `status: done` AND roadmap row `done`.
- `implementation` → unchanged; FEAT-2026-0008's three guards
  already cover.

Failure rolls back via `git reset --hard head_before`, records an
`attempt_outcome` event with `outcome: "closing_deliverable_missing"`
naming the failed assertion, and counts as a verification failure
in the attempt loop — three in a row escalate to `blocked_human`.

**Verification.** New tests under `tests/test_loop_closing_guard.py`
covering negative case (agent emits PASS without writing the
type-keyed deliverable, guard fires, attempt fails) and positive
case (agent writes everything, guard passes). Recursive audit per
LEARNINGS [FEAT-2026-0008/G1-CLOSE]: the close ceremony for this
feature must run the new guard against itself — if any deliverable
is missing, the close WU emits `status: blocked`, not `complete`.

**Status: planned.** Independent of FEAT-2026-0010/0011. Detail the
first gate's WUs when ready to start. Single gate, one substantive
WU (`closing-deliverable-guard`) + `close` ceremony — mirrors
FEAT-2026-0008's shape.


## Notes

- Correlation IDs are allocated here, sequentially per year: `FEAT-YYYY-NNNN`.
  Work units take `FEAT-YYYY-NNNN/TNN` for substantive units,
  `FEAT-YYYY-NNNN/G<n>-(RETRO|LESSONS|DOCS|PLAN)` for the four-WU closing
  sequence, and `FEAT-YYYY-NNNN/G<n>-CLOSE` for the single-gate `close`
  alternative — see `.specfuse/rules/correlation-ids.md`.
- The feature folder name carries the full ID plus a slug, so it greps,
  sorts, and threads cleanly.
- **Read `.specfuse/LEARNINGS.md` before detailing a new feature.** It is
  the accumulated output of every gate's lessons step and exists to make
  the next plan better than the last.
